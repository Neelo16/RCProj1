To compile the project, simply run "make" in the root folder. There are two
test TRS servers in TRS_Languages/, one in English and the other in German.

To exit any of the programs, simply type "exit".

You may also choose to simply send a SIGINT to terminate a TRS instance (the result will
be the same as if you type "exit").

Any remaining functionality will be the same as originally requested.

TRS requires a file called "text_translation.txt" and a file called
"file_translation.txt" in the same directory as the executable in order to
function properly. To start a TRS in a different language, it should be
executed in a different directory.
